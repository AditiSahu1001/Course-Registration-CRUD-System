Managing courses, students, and enrollments manually often leads to mistakes, missing information, and difficulty in tracking records. Institutions need a simple digital system that can store and manage this data in an organised way. The problem is the lack of an easy-to-use tool that supports basic operations like adding, viewing, updating, and deleting academic records without requiring a complex database setup.
This project covers the basic management of courses, students, and enrollments using Python and CSV files. It focuses on performing CRUD operations, maintaining accurate records, and providing a simple menu-driven interface. The system is designed for small institutions or learning environments where a lightweight and easy-to-run academic management tool is needed.
